Hotels allow for 24 hour on call service, if you lock yourself out or are having trouble with something... a hotel front desk can help immediately. Your $300 a night for a hotel in Boston covers that.... I am charging almost a 10th of that for this room. I have my own business, clients, and social obligations to attend to. If you lock yourself out or have some other issue, of course I will come help you, but its important to understand that it will not be immediate. I will do my best to get back to the house as quickly as possible. ***IMPORTANT** I'd rather save you all the money and trust you to be independent / responsible guests... than to charge you for my 24 hour support! So please -- keep your keys on hand and in sight, keep the room clean, and maintain healthy choices while in my space ",
