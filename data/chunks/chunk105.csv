If you could refrain from wearing perfume or cologne and using strong smelling shampoo and soap I would really appreciate it.  Natural products made with essential oils and herbs are fine.  For example, Aubrey Organics, Desert Essence and Avalon Organics are made with ingredients such as lavender, rose and coconut which are all fine. The room is on the third floor. There is no curfew.  I will give you a key and you can come and go as you please. I have an active life so sometimes I am not home but I do my best to be available by phone or text to assist you with your needs.  If you need something you can always call me, whether it is early in the morning or late at night.   You can keep things in the fridge and use the kitchen. You can use the washing machine and the dryer. This is a non-smoking household.  This includes the porch and the outdoor areas around the house.  Sorry,",
