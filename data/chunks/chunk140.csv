I have fragrance free shampoo, conditioner, body wash and soap available.  If you could refrain from wearing perfume or cologne and using strong smelling shampoo and soap I would really appreciate it.  Natural products made with essential oils and herbs are fine.  For example, Aubrey Organics, Desert Essence and Avalon Organics are made with ingredients such as lavender, rose and coconut which are all fine. The room is on the third floor. There is no curfew.  I will give you a key and you can come and go as you please. I have an active life so sometimes I am not home but I do my best to be available by phone or text to assist you with your needs.  If you need something you can always call me, whether it is early in the morning or late at night.   You can keep things in the fridge and use the kitchen. You can use the washing machine and the dryer. This is a non-smoking household.  This includes the porch and the outdoor areas around the house.  Sorry,",

Please clean after yourself on an on-going basis, especially in the common areas. We recycle paper, glass, metal in a separate bin, and throw food, plastic bags, and wrappers into the normal trash, can you participate? This 100 year old building has character in the details, but might appear less clean. The wood work was painted white before I moved in. I consistently use bleach between guests, but the grooves have ""greyed"" overtime, and I haven't repainted yet. I hope you won't be that picky ;-) My end-of-stay cleaning fee is to cover my time and expenses washing, drying, changing the sheets and sanitizing the room in between guests. I don't do any daily cleaning (of your room, the bathroom or the kitchen).
