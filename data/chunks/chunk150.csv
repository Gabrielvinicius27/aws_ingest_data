Please take off your shoes when you get in the house. Please don't bring any friends over unless they are confirmed guests. Please keep quiet after midnight. When booking for a weekend, please book on a Friday and for at least 3 nights, as I will not be around on Saturdays and Sundays to accept bookings. If neighbors asks, just tell them you're here to visit a friend. Don't tell then your guests from AirBNB. Please let me know exactly what time you will get to my house, or at least an hour ahead. I am not always at home so I will have to go hand keys to you and I will only have limited time. Thanks!",
