It is your responsibility to not only read these rules once, but to be aware of and follow all of them throughout your stay at my home. Most of what follows is common sense or common courtesy. The rules serve to protect you as a guest by helping ensure that the environment you find here is the one that I intended to create. Please keep in mind:  You will be sharing common areas with other guests or residents, and thus the cleanliness of the common areas is far more dependent upon all guests cleaning up after themselves, than it is upon my once a week cleaning. Most guests do very well in keeping common areas clean! House rules: Please do not drag luggage up the front stairs. Please leave things as they are in your room: do not remove pictures from walls, don't move furniture around, and do not remove mattress protector from the mattress. Also, it should not be necessary to say, but",

All bookings require a security deposit of at least $300. 4. For security measures we require all guests to provide proof of identification through ID verification on our own website. In order to check in, we'll need a photo of your ID.  5. Don’t let $300 go up in smoke. There's no smoking allowed in any Flatbook and a $300 fine for breaking this rule.  6.

We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.  1. Towels and linens (sheets, blankets, and pillows) are NOT provided. The bed is full size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  7. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes. So if you bring your o",
