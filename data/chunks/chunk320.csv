This same courtesy goes for the rest of the unit as well.  It's a real gem, thank you for helping to minimize cleaning fees and to help the next guest to enjoy it as much as you will. The furniture will be changed on Sept 14th, but will still be nicely set up. Also new screens have been installed, to avoid bugs in the early fall its best to have the Windows or screens down.  One last item is that with notice I may need to stop by / in the unit.  This would only be during the daytime, for a short duration, and would have 24 hr notice.  Thanks.  ;)",
