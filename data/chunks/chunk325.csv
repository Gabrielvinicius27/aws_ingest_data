We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.   4. If you re not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.   5. Check-in time is flexible, but it has to be coordinated at least 24 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.",
