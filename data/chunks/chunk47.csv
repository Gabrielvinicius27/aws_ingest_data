Whilst we do a thorough professional clean between each guest stay, we kindly ask that prior to leaving, you clean and put away any dishes or kitchenware used and put any dirty towels in the tub in the downstairs bathroom. It helps us get through our cleaning process quicker and allows us to keep cleaning costs down for you and future guests. Return all keys to the lock box at departure.  To keep our costs down (and pass those savings on to our guests) we kindly ask that you switch off lights, the air conditioner or heat when its not in use or",

I will go above and beyond for you!  That being said -- I do not charge hotel pricing for a reason. Hotels allow for 24 hour on call service, if you lock yourself out or are having trouble with something... a hotel front desk can help immediately. Your $300 a night for a hotel in Boston covers that.... I am charging almost a 10th of that for this room. I have my own business, clients, and social obligations to attend to. If you lock yourself out or have some other issue, of course I will come help you, but its important to understand that it will not be immediate. I will do my best to get back to the house as quickly as possible. ***IMPORTANT** I'd rather save you all the money and trust you to be independent / responsible guests... than to charge you for my 24 hour support! So please -- keep your keys on hand and in sight, keep the room clean, and maintain healthy choices while in my space ",
