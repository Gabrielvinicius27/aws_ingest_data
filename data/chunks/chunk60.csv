We are a strictly NON-SMOKING household - this includes all smokeable substances. We tend to stay up late, so late arrivals to about 11 pm or so are OK. We can arrange for a later check-in via a key box, but we may not meet you in person until the next morning. Check-in is after 5 pm except by prior arrangement, and checkout is at 11 am promptly to allow time for the unit to be cleaned before the next guest. This is a quiet residential neighborhood so please, no parties or loud music. There is door from the 3rd floor onto the roof as a safety exit, but the rubber roof is very delicate.  If you are tempted to walk out on the roof, please do so in your bare feet only.  There is no railing for the roof.  Under no circumstances may children access the roof.
