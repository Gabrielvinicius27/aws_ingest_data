Bigger black remote turns on the TV and Volume, Smaller black remote is for the Blue Ray Player. Comcast remote is for Cable. No loud music after 10:30, but head out on the town!! Uber and Lyft are great for getting cheaper, faster rides. The Buses are usually quicker and cleaner than the T, especially the B line. If taking the T, definitely walk to the C/D in Cleveland Circle. There are awesome fields and parks very close (walking) to the house.  Make sure to pick up after your dog.",
