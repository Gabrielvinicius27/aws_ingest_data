We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.    1. No smoking on the premises.  2. No loud music or TV etc.   3. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.   4. If you re not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.   5. Check-in time is flexible, but it has to be coordinated at least 24 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.",
